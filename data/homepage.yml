      company: Zeta Associates
      duration: September 2017 - October 2022
      description: |
        As a DevOps Engineer at Zeta Associates, I had the privilege of overseeing a wide range of responsibilities that kept 
        me constantly challenged and engaged. My primary focus was on architecting, building, and maintaining large scale cloud 
        agnostic infrastructure that enabled our team to deploy mission critical systems quickly, reliably, and repeatably to production.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of my most rewarding experiences was leading the full stack development effort on a unique webtop application, from MVP 
        to its accepted transition to ops. I was the single source developer for this project, which was written in Golang and Vue3 Typescript.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to these core responsibilities, I also deployed, developed, and maintained a variety of CNCF projects and cloud native 
        platforms, including Kubernetes, Hashicorp Vault, Gitlab, and Gitlab Runners. I served as the lead POC for a diverse range of devops 
        applications, processes, and pipelines, and was always eager to promote and advocate for an excellent developer experience across all 
        of our platforms and services.
        <br />
        <br />
        Overall, my time at Zeta Associates was characterized by a constant drive to innovate and improve, whether it was by streamlining our 
        infrastructure or enhancing the capabilities of our devops applications. It was a privilege to work alongside such a talented and dedicated 
        team, and I'm excited to bring these skills and experiences to my next opportunity.

        During my time at Northrop Grumman, I was able to develop and hone my skills in a variety of technical roles, including System Administrator, 
        Ground System Engineer, and Hardware Engineer.
        <br />
        <br />
        As a System Administrator, I provided critical Tier-2 support for detecting, isolating, and resolving ground segment problems. I was often the 
        first responder for all site issues, requiring a broad level of knowledge of high-priority systems across a multi-location enterprise. In 
        addition to resolving discrepancy reports, ranging from system change requests to site-wide outages, I also provided necessary mentorship, 
        guidance, and training to entry-level engineering crew.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my role as a Ground System Engineer, I provided 24/7 real-time operations and test support to Air Force crews and contractor test teams. 
        This included identifying system problems, troubleshooting, and correcting both software and hardware failures. I also participated in software 
        version testing and evaluation and provided feedback to the development and test community.
        <br />
        <br />
        Finally, as a Hardware Engineer, I configured and managed Linux/UNIX systems on a variety of platforms, including IRIX64, Solaris v8-10, Red Hat 
        EL 5.x-6.x. I gained hands-on experience with Veritas Cluster Servers and was well-versed in networking concepts like DHCP, TCP/IP, IP addressing, 
        networking technologies, and WLAN. I was also experienced in diagnosing, troubleshooting various networking, hardware, and Linux/UNIX server services
        issues and performing preventive maintenance.
        <br />
        <br />
        Overall, my time at Northrop Grumman allowed me to develop a deep understanding of complex technical systems and hone my ability to troubleshoot and 
        resolve issues in high-pressure environments. These experiences have prepared me well for any technical challenge that lies ahead.

        emergency destruction of cryptographic materials. This included daily, weekly, and monthly management of COMSEC materials to ensure the highest level of security
        for our mission-critical communications. Overall, my work as a Satellite and Wideband technician allowed me to develop a broad range of technical skills and
        expertise that were essential to supporting the Air Force National Guard's mission.
